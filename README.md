# Diamond-Bats-Minecraft-Addon

This addon gives Minecraft Bedrock bats a purpose, and converts them into a new mob entirely.

Diamond Bats have a similar appearence to the old bat, except Diamond Bats are made completely out of diamond, giving them a shiny teal look. They drop a diamond on kill, and
have a 25% chance to drop a damaged diamond armor piece. Diamond Bats have 50 health, making them much tougher than the average mob. Make sure you kill them quick before they get
away! This addon makes a great addition when combined with other custom mob addons.
